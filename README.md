# Motion-and-Light-Sensored-Vanity-Mirror
A custom built vanity mirror that detects the amount of light in the room based on current brightness from various factors (sunlight through a window, other lights in the room that are on), and also detects motion when the user walks in front of it in order to be able to turn on its bulbs to the appropriate brightness.
